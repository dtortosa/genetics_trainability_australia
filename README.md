# Genetics of trainability

This repository includes scripts to process and analyze the genetic data (i.e., SNPs) of Australian soliders that underwent a training regime. The goal is to develop a polygenic score that captures the influence of genetics on the response to training (i.e., before vs after) in terms of cardiovascular fitness.
